             I am Steven Ecsarlan. I am 16 yaers old.There are lot of things that changed when I entered college. There are
some changes. Some are routines,relationship,assumptions and roles. 
              
             Some of the routines are waking up not very early in the morning. The way I prepare myself on going to school 
have changed,too. The routes that I am taking to school is very different. Before,I only commute just around Pasig but this 
year,I am going around many places epecially Manila City. Last four years of my high school life, I just wait for the teacher
to arrive but today I am going to different rooms.

             There are new relationships that I had this past few days. I met new friends and classmates. I found them easy 
to get along with. But sometimes they were just too noisy. However,those guys are just very happy people. 

             When I go to college,there are assumptions that I expect and I assume. First is that I expect that I will enjoy
here at De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde. Many had told me that I should enroll there because it is a wonderful college.
Then, I assume that it is easy to get along with many Benildeans.

             Well that's all that I can say. thanks and good day.
